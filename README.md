Trucking Logistics and Route Planner System

The Trucking Logistics and Route Planner System is a group project aimed at simplifying the management of trucks, drivers, and shipments while optimizing delivery routes. The application will be developed using Java and JavaFX, providing a user-friendly interface for managing fleets and deliveries. Companies will be able to register trucks and drivers, assign shipments based on truck capacity, and calculate the most efficient delivery routes using shortest-path algorithms such as Dijkstra’s or A*.

The system will feature CRUD operations for trucks, drivers, and loads, along with a visual route planner that displays paths on a graph or map-based view. Data will be stored in a local SQLite database, ensuring persistence across sessions. The system will also validate constraints such as cargo weight limits and driver working hours, notifying users when an assignment is not possible. By integrating data management, optimization algorithms, and visualization, this project will deliver a practical logistics solution that reduces costs, improves scheduling, and increases efficiency.

User Requirements
•	Ability to register, update, and remove trucks, drivers, and loads.
•	Route calculation between pickup and drop-off points.
•	Validation of constraints (e.g., truck capacity, driver working hours).
•	User-friendly JavaFX interface for easy navigation.
•	Notifications when assignments are invalid or infeasible.

Specifications and Interface Needs
•	JavaFX interface with forms and tables for CRUD operations.
•	Graph visualization or simple map view for route planning.
